# MoreMinerals

###### A Mod that adds more mineral variety to your game.

###### Request by: @Tyelan Sin

## Features:

- 3 new mineral types:
  
  - Gold `Au`, worth 5.8 E$/kg
  - Silver `Ag`, worth 8.6 E$/kg
  - Silicon `Si`, worth 2.6 E$/kg

- Multiple minerals per chunk!
  
  - Every mineral chunk has a chance to contain more than one type of mineral.
  - Less pure mineral chunks will tend to contain more of the other minerals.

## Installation:

To install, go to the game's installation directory (the directory containing `Delta-V.pck`), and create a new directory called `mods`. Place the mod `.zip` in this `mods` directory, this must be `MoreMinerals.zip` and not an extracted folder.

To run the game with mods, run it with the `--enable-mods` command-line parameter. If using Steam, you can add the parameter in the game's properties → General → Launch Options.
