-THICCC-
SYSTEM_EXCOM|THI Combined Cargo Container
SYSTEM_EXCOM_DESC|A variant of the standard THI Cargo Container that utilizes a combined cargo bay to increase versitility at the cost of reduced total capacity and increased dry mass. These require on-site mineral processing units to utilize. The equipment purchase of the cargo cradle comes with a lease covering the resupply of new pods for as long as the owner holds the license.\n\nStation control warns that retrofit with certain RCS configurations may risk overheating the Cargo Container's micro-reactor. Captains assume all such liability.
SYSTEM_EXCOM_SPECS|Cargo capacity (combined): 60,000 kg\nPower usage (nominal): 20 MW\nCradle mass: 500 kg\nManufacturer: Titan Heavy Industries
SYSTEM_EXCOM_MANUAL|Automatically stores processed ore.\nYou can customize ore stored on Geologist tab.\nRequires mineral processing unit to be used effectively.\nWill unbalance the ship if only one is installed.\nCan be ejected by disabling the hardpoint.\nThe ejected container will attempt to return to the station with its cargo automatically.\nEmpty cradle arm can catch drones and lifepods.

SHIP_AT225-H|Antonoff-Titan K225 "Atlas"
SHIP_AT225-H_SPECS|Make: Antonoff-Titan Heavy Industries\nHigh-Stress Hardpoints: 2\nLow-Stress Hardpoints: 2\nDocking Bays: 2\nCrew: 12\nDry mass: 175,000 kg\nCargo bay: 395 m^3\nProcessed cargo storage: 7,000 kg
SHIP_AT225-H_DESC|A highly complex refit that involves splitting the entire ship into three peices and inverting the central segment. The end result provides enough structural stability that the power and feeds for the rear docking bays can be fitted to supply a high-stress hardpoint on both sides.
